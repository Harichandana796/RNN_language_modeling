# RNN language modeling

This is a Jupyter Notebook for the course [Speech Recognition](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02A6AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp33776) (Master Artificial Intelligence) at KU Leuven.

The notebook contains a combination of text and Python code, and should be run with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
It gives a demonstration of the basics of language modeling with recurrent neural networks, which involves data processing, word embeddings, testing a network and hyperparameter tuning.

Follow these steps to get started:

* To be able to use Google Colab, you need to have a Google account. If you have one, make sure you are logged in. 
* Download the files in download/ and save them locally on your computer. These contain Python classes and functions that you will import in the notebook, but you don't need to know the details of their workings. 
* Open rnn_lm.ipynb and click on 'Open in Colab' at the top of the file.
