# RNN language modeling

This is a Jupyter Notebook for the course [Speech Recognition](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02A6AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp33776) (Master Artificial Intelligence) at KU Leuven.

The notebook contains a combination of text and Python code, and should be run with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
It gives a demonstration of the basics of language modeling with recurrent neural networks, which involves data processing, word embeddings, testing a network and hyperparameter tuning.

Follow these steps to get started:

* To be able to use Google Colab, you need to have a Google account. If you have one, make sure you are logged in. 
* Download the files in download/ and save them locally on your computer. These contain Python classes and functions that you will import in the notebook, but you don't need to know the details of their workings. 
* In your browser, click on rnn_lm.ipynb on the Github page. Once the notebook has opened, click on 'Open in Colab' at the top of the file.
* When you try to run one of the cells, you will get a warning about the fact that the notebook not authored is by Google. Make sure that you tick the box 'Reset all runtimes before running' and then click on 'Run anyway'. It will ask for confirmation, so click 'yes'.
