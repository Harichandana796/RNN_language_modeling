# RNN language modeling

This is a Jupyter Notebook for the course [Speech Recognition](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02A6AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp33776) (Master Artificial Intelligence) at KU Leuven.

The notebook contains a combination of text and Python code, and should be run with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
It gives a demonstration of the basics of language modeling with recurrent neural networks, which involves data processing, word embeddings, testing a network and hyperparameter tuning.
